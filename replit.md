# Overview

This is a production-ready AI Image Generator API built for Cloudflare Workers. The application integrates with external AI services for image generation and public storage services for image hosting. It provides a RESTful API that returns both base64-encoded images and public URLs, making it suitable for various use cases including RapidAPI integration.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Serverless Architecture
The application is built as a Cloudflare Worker, utilizing serverless architecture for automatic scaling and global distribution. This approach provides:
- Zero cold starts with Cloudflare's edge network
- Automatic HTTPS and global CDN distribution
- Cost-effective pay-per-request pricing model

## API Design
The system follows RESTful API principles with:
- **Health Check Endpoint** (`GET /`): Returns API status and available endpoints
- **Image Generation Endpoint** (`POST /generate-image`): Main functionality for AI image generation
- **CORS Support**: Full CORS implementation for cross-origin requests
- **JSON-based Communication**: All requests and responses use JSON format

## Image Processing Pipeline
The application implements a dual-output strategy:
1. **AI Generation**: Uses external AI service API for text-to-image generation
2. **Storage Service**: Integrates with public storage service for image hosting
3. **Response Format**: Returns both base64-encoded images and public URLs

## Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling includes:
- Input validation for required parameters
- External API failure handling
- CORS preflight request management
- Structured error responses with success/failure indicators

## Development Workflow
The project uses Wrangler CLI for:
- Local development server (`npm run dev`)
- Production deployment (`npm run deploy`)
- Environment management for staging/production

# External Dependencies

## AI Image Generation Service
- **External AI Service**: Primary service for AI-powered image generation from text prompts
- **Integration Method**: HTTP API calls for image generation requests

## Image Storage Service
- **Public Storage Service**: File hosting service for converting images to publicly accessible URLs
- **Usage**: Provides permanent URLs for generated images

## Development and Deployment Tools
- **Wrangler**: Cloudflare Workers CLI tool for development, testing, and deployment
- **Cloudflare Workers Runtime**: Serverless execution environment

## Potential Marketplace Integration
- **RapidAPI Ready**: Architecture designed for easy integration with RapidAPI marketplace
- **Standard REST API**: Compatible with API marketplace requirements
